# strengthprediction
This project focused on predicting the comprehensive strength of the concrete based on various predictor variables such as Cement, BlastFurnaceSlag, FlyAsh, Water, Superplasticizer, CoarseAggregate, FineAggregate, Age using Machine learning techniques. Several machine learning models are used in this project: linear regression, K-nearest neighbors, Lasso regression, bagging, random forest, and MARS. This project highlighted the importance of proper data splitting, feature engineering and also a proper model selection for making the prediction model. Testing the error of the model it was found that Bagging was the best model with minimal error of 5.206023 and closest to it was of random forest (5.319993). Predictions were made on test data and an error of 4.10974 was received. Overall the project successfully was able to predict the Strength of the concrete with minimal error with the given dataset.
